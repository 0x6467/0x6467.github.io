<p>Richard Prince was not Marcel Duchamp. Richard Prince wasn't the Ready-Made Token artist either.</p>
<p>By appropriating Richard Prince, the Distributed Gallery has created a scam inside the so-called contemporary art, but through the universe of the blockchain. The Rare Digital Art Festival has invited the Distributed Gallery and Richard Prince to exhibit the RMT. And naturally, the Distributed Gallery was pleased to invite the manager of Richard Prince to present his new work of appropriation. Can we appropriate an appropriator ? The RMT exhibition at The Rare Digital Art Festival did not take place, but the auction continued, making a token a Fountain 3.0, and art a true cryptoart.</p>
<p>In a certain way, Richard Prince is the creator of the Ready-Made Token, insofar as it is the blockchain technology, the Distributed Gallery and the anonymity they underlie that has appropriated the figurehead of appropriation art. The art world did the rest, inviting this Richard Prince and the Distributed Gallery to a public show and relaying the news within its network. The Ready-Made Token is a Ready-Made in the sense that it draws its artistic and conceptual evidence from a process by which anonymous people, the Distributed Gallery, have drawn the logic of appropriation to its limit.</p>
