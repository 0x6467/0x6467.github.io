<p>The Distributed Gallery is a collective of thinkers and tinkers
engaged in a critical approach toward art markets and artistic
worlds. Disturbed by the overinterpretation of artistic intentions,
the Distributed Gallery defends a more sensitive and authentic
approach of the so-called contemporary art. Moreover, it wishes to
replace in the center of the game the collective anonymous work in
which the figure of the artist evaporates.</p>

<p>The Distributed Gallery was inaugurated under the double sign of Dada and Blockchain through its first art work: the Ready-Made Token. In 1917 Marcel Duchamp's famous &quot;urinal&quot; was exhibited in New York, a ready-made, that is to say a common object elevated to the state of art by its simple conceptualization and its exhibition in a gallery. A century later, a certain Richard Prince, an artist known for his work of appropriation, launched the Ready-Made Token: the transformation of a cryptographic unit into a work of art. By exploring the potential of Blockchain technology, the Ready-Made Token marked the first conceptual link between cryptocurrency and the art world.</p>
